- Main goal is to learn
- Hopefully support both 2D and 3D
- Target Platform most likely just to be windows, linux and maybe android if possible one day. Priority just windows/linux

- programming language to be used: c++
- using vscode and CMake (probably)

- Features:
    - Physics
        - Rigid Body Dynamics
        - Collision Detection
        - Soft Body Dynamics (deformable objects)
        - Ragdoll physics
    - Rendering
        - 2D and 3D sprites and models
        - Shading and Lighting
        - Materials and Textures
        - Post-Processing effects, e.g. bloom, motion blur, depth of field
    - Audio
        - 3D sound - positioning sounds in a 3D environment
        - Sound effects
        - Audio mixing
    - Scripting and Logic
        - Scripting Languages (lua, cpp, custom scripting (could be really fun))
        - Event System, event handling and messaging between game components
        - AI Systems (tools and frameworks for creating AI)
    - Input Handling (if necessary, might just stick to KBM for now)
        - Keyboard and Mouse
        - Gamepad/Joystick
        - Touch and Gestures
    - Animation System
        - Skeletal Animation
        - Morph Target Animation (vertex-based deformation)
        - Animation Blending (smooth transitions between animations)
    - Networking (low priority, if included)
        - Client-Server Architecture (framework for networked games)
        - Synchronisation
        - Matchmaking
    - Resource Management (loading, unloading, caching of game assets)
        - Asset Pipeline (tolls for importing and processing game assets)
        - Memory Management (efficient use of memory for assets and game objects)
    - Scene Management
        - Scene Graph (hierarchal organisation of objects)
        - Level of Detail (adjusting detail based off distance)
        - Culling (optimising rendering by excluding off-screen objects) (FOV?)
    - GUI and UI systems
        - UI elements (buttons, sliders, etc.)
        - Layout Management
        - HUD
    - Tools and Editors
        - Level Editor (designing game levels and placing objects)
        - Script Editor (Writing and Debugging scripts)
        - Material Editor
    - Debugging and profiling
        - Debugging
        - Profiling
        - Logging
    - Platform Support
        - Cross-Platform
        - Build System (tools for packaging and deploying games)
    - VR/AR Support (incredibly unlikely)
    - Asset Store/Marketplace Integration (also unlikely)
